# Thymeless

## Information

This is the file(s) for the bot used to run our Discord smoothly, eventually to be hosted on the cloud.

As of October 2019 this repo has been changed to reflect the current Discord bot being worked on, as the last one kept no interest and had no progress.

Current Discord bot capabilities:

- Respond to preset prompts (hard-coded for now)
- Give people XP for chatting (hard-coded and not time restricted for now)
- Makes the server smaller by requiring less bots to do the same functions
